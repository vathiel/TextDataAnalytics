[VERSE 1]

IN THIS LIFE OF UNCERTAINTY
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL NEED
SOMEONE TO FACE YOU, WITH NO DISGUISE
IN YOU THERES A REMEDY
THAT MAKES EVERYDAY SEEM TROUBLE FREE
NO DISTANCE AND NO DEVICE

[BRIDGE 1]

'COS YOU HEAR THE WORDS
WHEN NO ONE UNDERSTANDS

[CHORUS]

WHEN MY WORLD HAS COME UNDONE
AND I'VE LOST MY SETTING SUN
WHEN ALL I SEE ARE CLOUDS
YOU'RE STILL AROUND
WHEN I FALL INTO A TEAR
INSPIRATIONS DISAPPEAR
YOU CLEAR AWAY THAT DOUBT
'COS YOU'RE STILL, YOU'RE STILL AROUND

[VERSE 2]

NOW I'VE STUMBLED ON UNCERTAINTY
NEVER THOUGHT THIS COULD EVER BE
NO CONTRADICTIONS LEFT INSIDE
WHEN I FEEL THE RAIN COME MY WAY
YOU GIVE ME SUN, YOU'RE MY BRIGHTER DAY
INTUITION'S TELLING ME TO STAY

[BRIDGE 2]

'COS YOU HOLD THE WORDS WHEN NOTHINGS LEFT TO SAY
[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]

IN THIS LIFE OF UNCERTAINTY
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL NEED
SOMEONE TO FACE YOU, WITH NO DISGUISE
IN YOU THERES A REMEDY
THAT MAKES EVERYDAY SEEM TROUBLE FREE
NO DISTANCE AND NO DEVICE

[BRIDGE 3]

'COS YOU HOLD THE WORDS
WHEN NOTHINGS LEFT TO SAY

[CHORUS REPEAT X 2]
