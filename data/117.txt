Boy, you know you make me float
Boy, you really get me high
I feel like I'm on dope
'Cause you—you serve me on a regular

Boy, we need to tie this rope
Before we drift any deeper
Baby, now pull me close
Boy, let's take this overboard now

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle,
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions,
New positions, new positions, new positions
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Ooh, baby, I love your stroke
'Cause you—'cause you get me where I'm going
And surely you'd get my vote
'Cause I believe
I believe you know just what you doing now

Baby, now we can coast
Let's coast, let's coast
Let's don't get in a hurry
That's too slow
Go ahead and put that thing in overdrive

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle,
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Work it, baby. Work it, baby
Change positions,
New positions, new positions, new positions
Now stroke it, baby
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle,
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions,
New positions, new positions, new positions
Now stroke it, baby
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Stroke it for me
Stroke it, baby. Stroke, it baby
Mmmm, work it, baby. Work it, baby
Ooh stroke it
There is somethin' I want you to do
I need you to use yourself
Like you never ever used to do before
Never
To explore my body
Explore it, body
Until you reach the shore
You'll be calling, calling for more

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle,
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions,
New positions, new positions, new positions
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle,
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions,
New positions, new positions, new positions
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions,
New positions, new positions, new positions
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
