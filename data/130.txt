[Aaliyah (R. Kelly):]
(Let me see you go back)
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
(Let me see you come forth
Now let me see you go back)
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
(Let me see you come forth
Uh, let me see you go back)
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
(Let me see you come forth
Uh, let me see you go back)
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
(let me see you come forth)

It's Friday
And I'm ready to swing
Pick up my girls
And hit the party scene
Tonight
It's alright

So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood
'Cause you know it's alright

(so Mr. DJ keep the music grooving)
Keep on grooving
(Don't stop moving)
Don't stop moving
Let me see you, let me see you go

(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Go back
Let me see you go
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
Alright
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
I wanna see you go
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
Come on
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Let me see you go
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
See you go back and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)

Now's the time for you
To make your move
To the dance floor
So throw your hands in the air
And wave them 'round like you just don't care
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
Ripping up the stage
I got jazz personality,
G mentality
Beats from Soul Train

(so Mr. DJ keep the music grooving)
Keep on grooving
Don't stop moving
Now let me see you go back and forth

(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
Come on
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Let me see you go

[R. Kelly:]
Hey here's the formality
Get upon the floor
You see show your personality
Be who you wanna be
Tell me

[Aaliyah:]
See can you feel the groove
Moving when I'm with you
Hey I wanna keep this party going on all night

(so Mr. DJ keep the music grooving)
Keep on grooving
(Don't stop moving)
Don't stop moving
Now let me see you go back and forth

(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Alright
Let me see you go
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Go back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Go back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Bringing back, thinking forth
Alright
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
Back, back, forth, and forth
(Let me see you back and forth, now check it)
[Repeat until fade out]

Let me see you go
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
[Repeat until fade out]
