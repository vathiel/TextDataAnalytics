Believe in your heart
No matter what the people might say. 
The chance you take could take you to the top.

Listen up
You know you gotta throw your fear away. 
Together we can make it
Shake it up baby.

[Break]

[Bridge:]
Hear the voices rock the nation
A calling to the skies I can see eternity is in your eyes. 

[Bridge:]
Come on everybody there's a party to go to. 
They're holding out for you! 
With every chance you take, a change you make. 
The start of something new.

[Chorus:]
All around the world they are singing
Calling to the beginning. 
Oh oh oh celebrate our love, People with imagination. 
Everywhere a celebration. 
Oh oh oh celebrate our love!

Good to be free
Living out our own destiny. 
The best will last forever
Never stop.

Gotta move
You know we gotta groove into the light. 
Tonight will be the night that we're breaking it up
Break it down baby.

[Bridge]
[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Oh oh, oh oh, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na. Oh oh, oh oh 
Celebrate our love.

Let the rhythm take control
Feel the fire burn within your soul. 
There's a magic in your eyes
Forever we can take the music thru the night.
[Repeat Chorus: Till End.]
