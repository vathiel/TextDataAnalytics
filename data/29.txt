When you're weary, When you're down and out
Lay your hands on me [x2]

I count my blessings, think of all I have
She never thought about it then threw it all away
Left it all to chance, She tore down fences
Now it seems so wasted wish she could turn back time.

[Chorus]
Now she's down on her knees to pray
Baby please make it good, make it good somehow
She will do anything to change
So please make it good, make it good somehow
Someone please

When you're weary, when you're down and out
Lay your hands on me

had a vision. Time to make a stand
for all she is to me, to turn her life around
To take back yesterday's never easy
When you're wrong you're wrong. It seems impossible so

[CHORUS]

Welcome to your revoloution 
What you dream is what you see
There's no rules or regulations
Let the music set you free

[Chorus]

When you're weary, When you're down and out
Lay your hands on me [x2]
