[paul]
wherever  we go,same old story
say you can't take no more and you wanna go home
i give up, i dont know, just how to keep going
when i see tears roll down your face...oh no

[mark]
oh you got me going round and round
yeah you got my life and turned it upside down

[chorus (ben)]
you make it going round and round in circles
going down down down
we keep talking bout the same old things
we keep covering the same old ground
yeah we keep going around and i got to get out
this ain't what love is about

[paul]
the clocks keep on turning 
the days come and go
i think of you and know i can't let your memory go,ohh

[christian]
oh you got me,help me off the ground
yeah you got my life and turned it [mark] upside down
[repeat chorus]

[christian]
there's one way to cross this river
but i don't know if i can deliver
i feel broke im down on my knees
we can't go on like this

[ben]
yeah we keep going around and round in circles
going down down down
we keep on talking bout the same old things 
we keep covering the same old ground
[repeat]
this ain't what love is all about
oohhh woooh....ooohh woooh
yeah
this ain't what love is about
i know, i know....no no no no
this ain;t what love is about
ooohh wooohh ....wooooh oooh yeah 
oh girl.
