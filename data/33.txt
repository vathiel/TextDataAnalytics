The crazy things I heard you say
I'm mad about you all the same
I never really saw the crime
Yet went ahead and served my time
I never met someone like you before
But sometimes that is not enough
'Cause I can't help just feeling

I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you

I will regret this chosen mind
I never wanna see you cry
I care about you endlessly
You deserve a deeper love than me
I don't know if I'll make it on my own
But I tried so hard to let it go
And I can't hide this feeling

I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you

And I know that I will miss you like a fool
But there's something in my life
And I can't hide this feeling

I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you
