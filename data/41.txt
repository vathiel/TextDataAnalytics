<TITULO>"Let It Out"</TITULO><LYRICS>

[Mark:]
You said you need a groom this evening 
I told you I'm leaving 
Till you begged me to stay 
You got your high heels on to tease me 
You promised to please me 
Then you take it away 

[Mark:]
The fire is fading baby stoke it up 
And let it roll up your sleeves 
Why can’t you tell me that we're breaking up 
And that I need space to breath 

[All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

[Mark:]
Let it in

[Paul:]
You used to keep me up till the morning 
Keeping me warm untill I had to be gone 
And now you can’t find a room in your head 
You see you got out of bed 
Well that my coffee ain't on 

[Paul:]
The door was open do you locked it up 
And then you threw out the key 
Why can’t you tell me that we're breaking up 
That I need space to breath 

[All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

[All:]
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait 
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait  

[All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

[All:]
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait 

[All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in 

[Mark:]
Let it out 

[Paul:]
No I can’t wait 
Till you let me in 
I can’t wait 

[Mark:]
No I can’t wait 
You got to let it out
