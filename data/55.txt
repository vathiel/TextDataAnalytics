Baby don’t, baby don’t, treat me right
I better get, better get outta sight
Guess my dinner’s in the dog tonight
Shouting out, shouting out at me all night
Ringing in my ears till the morning light
Baby just wanna have a fight tonight

Alright, it’s okay
Tomorrow’s another day

I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try

Baby don’t, baby don’t break away
Hear me out, hear me out, what I say
I can’t take it for another day 
Burning up, burning up, baby stop
Cool it down now before you blow your top
I guess the dog’s back sleeping in my spot

Alright, it’s okay
Tomorrow is another day

I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try

Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me 
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me

You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right

I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try

Just trust me
Try
