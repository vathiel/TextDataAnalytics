Standing in line, talking ‘bout nothing
When you walk right by
And I wanna say something but 
I’m so shy it hurts
You don’t see me if I gave you my compass
Then would you be more like Christopher Columbus
And explore my world

Hey now I’ve gotta tell you
No I’m bursting to tell you
I can’t keep it inside

Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come knock knock on my door

So the secret’s out I’ve been discovered
I’m feeling vulnerable my heart’s uncovered
But there’s no reply
I’ll still be here
I’ll still be waiting
I’ll keep a look out until your ship comes sailing in
Will you ever be mine

Hey now how can I show you
I’m bursting to tell you
I can’t keep it inside

Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door

Am I too late
Have you been discovered
I wish I’d been more like Christopher Columbus
And found you first

Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door
