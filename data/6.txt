[BEN:] I SAID I'D NEVER LEAVE YOU.
I SAID THAT I WOULD NEVER LET YOU DOWN.
I NEEDED A CHANCE TO PROVE MY LOVE TO YOU
TIL' TIME IS THROUGH.

[MARK:] THE PROMISES I GAVE YOU,
I NEVER MEANT TO SEE THEM LEFT UNTRUE.
YOU WERE MY EVERYTHING, I GIVE MY
HEART TO YOU - TO START A NEW.

[CHRISTIAN:] AND ALL OF THE DAYS JUST PASS ME BY.
SO I PRAY, AND I'M ASKING WHY

[BEN:] ALL THAT I ASK IS ONE MORE TRY.
COS I NEVER WANNA SAY GOODBYE.

[ALL:] IF ONLY I LISTENED TO MY HEART.
THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE APART.
NOW ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU.
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO.
IF ONLY WE TWO COULD START A NEW
I PROMISE I'D NEVER BE UNTRUE.
COS ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO.

[CHRISTIAN:] YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER
I'M LOOKING FOR A CHANCE WITH YOU AGAIN
I GUESS I NEVER SHOWED YOU
WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME
CAN'T YOU SEE.

[PAUL:] EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU,
AND EVERYTHING I DID I FEEL WAS WRONG
I DIDN'T KNOW THE WORDS I SAID WOULD
MAKE YOU LEAVE, PLEASE BELIEVE

[MARK:] AND ALL OF THE DAYS JUST PASS ME BY.
SO I PRAY, AND I'M ASKING WHY

[BEN:] ALL THAT I ASK IS ONE MORE TRY.
COS I NEVER WANNA SAY GOODBYE

[ALL:] IF ONLY I LISTENED TO MY HEART.
THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE APART.
NOW ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU.
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO.
IF ONLY WE TWO COULD START A NEW
I PROMISE I'D NEVER BE UNTRUE.
COS ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO

[PAUL + CHRISTIAN:] IF ONLY, IF ONLY, IF ONLY, ALL I DO
IF ONLY, IF ONLY, IF ONLY, ALL I DO X 2 

[BEN + MARK:] IF ONLY I'D LISTENED TO MY HEART,
THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE APART.
NOW ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO

[ALL:] IF ONLY I LISTENED TO MY HEART.
THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE APART.
NOW ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU.
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO.
IF ONLY WE TWO COULD START A NEW
I PROMISE I'D NEVER BE UNTRUE.
COS ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO

[ALL:] IF ONLY I LISTENED TO MY HEART.
THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN'T BE APART.
NOW ALL I CAN DREAM ABOUT IS YOU.
AND BABY THAT'S ALL I DO.
IF ONLY WE TWO COULD START A NEW
I PROMISE I'D NEVER BE UNTRUE.
