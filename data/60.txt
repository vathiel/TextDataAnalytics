Is Anybody there? I come up for air
Feels like I’m drowning
Does anybody care?
It makes no sense at all
Such a long way to fall.
I knew it was coming
I could feel it in the air

Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I've fallen from grace

Is anyone around?
My head hits the ground
I feel like I’m no one
I’m lost in the crowd
It makes no sense at all
So divided we fall
I’m breaking my silence
But you don't hear me call
And you don’t see me fall

Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I've fallen from grace

And everyday just feels the same
I try so hard to walk away from everything I am
Just closing in on me
I just can’t face the pain
I sit around and wonder why?
So many dreams can fade and die
Well nothing is forever everything is never
And I can’t say goodbye

Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I’ve fallen from grace
