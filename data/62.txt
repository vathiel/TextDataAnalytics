Your eyes they tell me something
I heard a rumor saying you're alone again
On your own again

That really got me thinking
I know that you're looking for love but maybe
Until then you just need a friend

We don't have to tell nobody
Our secret safe don't worry
No string no complication
It's just a win-win situation

Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]

Go separate ways when leaving
Both know when later you'll be home with me
Be alone with me yeah 
No heart that we're deceiving
No harm in what we're feeling
As long as we don't think of what could be

We don't have to tell nobody
Our secret safe don't worry
No string no complication
It's just a win-win situation

Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]

Go out go out

Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]
