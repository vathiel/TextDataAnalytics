I'll love you till kingdom come
That's the way where I come from
Build a heart that's made to last
Shape the future with the past

Hold a lantern, light the way
Walk with you into the fray
Face our demons side by side
We're an army, you and I

I'll be there with sword in hand
A cavalry at your command
Lead the charge, I'll be your shield
Standin' on the battlefield
Nothing can harm you, I'll be the armour
For your heart

We will leave no stone unturned
Walk away from bridges burned
With the world here at our feet
We're an army, you and me

I'll be there with sword in hand
A cavalry at your command
Lead the charge, I'll be your shield
Standin' on the battlefield
Nothing can harm you, I'll be the armour
For your heart

Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

I'll be there with sword in hand
A cavalry at your command
Lead the charge, I'll be your shield
Standin' on the battlefield
Nothing can harm you, I'll be the armour
For your heart
