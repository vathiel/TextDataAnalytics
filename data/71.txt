<TITULO>"Come On Down"</TITULO><LYRICS>

I can’t help but I wanna be around you
Can’t forget about my home
When I’m lonely
You might not know but I always think about you
As you fall upon your soul
I wanna thank you

Home is where I belong
It’s a place, I’m taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on

Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down

You’re always around when I have some time to steal
When I need some time to heal 
For remedy (for remedy)
And there are times when it’s hard to be myself
Turn me into someone else
But you know me

Home is where I belong
But it’s a place, I’m taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on
And on and on

Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Stay around
Come on down
Come on down

Call on to please me tonight in a while
Just so I’m kind when I’m home
Days turn to seasons and years have gone by
Hold on

Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down

[Instrumental]

I said come on down
Coz there’s a fire in my heart
I said and you’ll look down
Just I need you here right now
You gotta come on down
And bring me back to solid ground
Come on down
