<TITULO>"Hide Your Love"</TITULO><LYRICS>

I keep trying 
Ain’t no denying
We should be together now
I can’t imagine
You’re with another man
Baby, it can be wrong

To play with, in this love
After all of this time
(All of this time)

You can’t hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
You can’t hide your love
(Hide your love)
(You gotta hide your love)

I can remember
Last time you needed me
I’m always here left to know
And when it all goes wrong 
And things are not the same
I’m always your price to pay	

But I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)

You can’t hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
You can’t hide your love
(Hide your love)
(Hide your love, oh my)

Can we, in this love
Yes I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
All of this time

You can’t hide your love from me
(From me, deep inside…)
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
(Walk away, if you wanna stay)
You can’t hide your love
