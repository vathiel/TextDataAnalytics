[Ben]
Maybe I don't even exist
So I'll stay anonymous
It's over and the situation shouted in shame
And they say it's down to us
But what do they know
[All]
So write, this time
Till it's starting or ending
I'll never get tired of your lies

[Ben]
But what you've got to visualize
[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
[Ben]
Either get it high or go dry
This time

[Paul]
I see you're playing that song again
You never show your hand 
To let me in

[Paul]
You keep it all inside yourself
And cry to no one else
But I catch your tears

[All]
So I write
[Ben]
So I write,this time
This time

Till it's starting or ending ([Ben:] starting)
I'll never get tired of your lies

[Paul]
But what you've got to visualize ([Ben:] oh, oh)
[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
Either get it high or go dry
[Paul]
Either get it high or go dry

[Mark]
You say this love will see another day
But at least tonight
You'll be mine

[All]
So I write ([Mark:] so I write), this time ([Mark:] this time)
Till it's starting or ending ([Mark:] starting or ending)
I'll never get tired of your lies ([Mark:] oh, oh)

[Paul]
But what you've got to visualize
[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
Either get it high or go dry

[Ben]
Gonna go, gonna go
Gonna go high or get dry
Yeah, yeah ([All:] either get it high or go dry)
We either ([All:] go dry)

([Paul:] high and dry)
([Ben:] no...) either get it high or go dry
([Paul:] high and dry)
([Ben:] we either go)
([Mark:] high or dry) ([Ben:] no...)
So I write ([Ben:] this time, baby, this time
