<TITULO>"Power Of Desire"</TITULO><LYRICS>

[Chris:] Fallin' for a fantasy
I threw away my destiny
I don't know where to stop
Feelin' broken-hearted

I'll think about it
And to see my eyes 
To cry to dry
for I've forced
All this time [2x]
With you, ooh...

[Chris:] I was tempted by the power of desire
I surrendered to the calling of the fire
There's nothing I could ever say
to change the things I did
But I promise you
I'll make it up to you

[Mark:] Take me back to yesterday
When all our dreams were swept away
I'd never crossed that line
I changed across of time

I could never live this way
If only you'd forgive
We'll start again
With all my heart
All my love for you [2x]

[Mark & Chris: (chorus)]

[break]

[Mark & Chris:] No surrender no return
If only you believe that...

[Chris & Mark: (chorus)]
