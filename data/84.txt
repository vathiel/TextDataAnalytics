[Ben:] The sun is shining, the rain comes in 
And i don't know what to do, no... 
I don't know where i'm going or where i've been cos my mind is hooked on you. 
Words escape me and tears come down and day slowly turns to night 
And i think of all we could have been, 
I gave up the fight. 

[Ben:] And you don't 
([All:] you don't), 
Understand 
([All:] understand), 
Girl you make me all i am, 
But i'm starting to see, just how hard it can be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? 

[Ben:] You said that we'd been defeated 
But oh i am so addicted 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why 
No, i don't know why 

[Paul:] The days around me and years roll on 
And i still don't think it's right 
([All:] don't think it's right) 
And i have so much love to give, 
But i gave up the fight. 

[Paul:] Now you don't 
([All:] you don't), 
Understand 
([All:] understand), 
Girl you made me all i am, 
Now i've started to see, just how hard it could be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? 

[Ben:] You said that we'd been defeated, 
But oh i am so addicted, 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true, 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why. 

[Paul:] No i can't make it alone 
([Ben:] i don't know why) 
And i can't be here without you in my life 
And so i ask you, why, you still deny? 

[Ben:] And you don't, 
Understand, 
Girl you made me all i am 
But i'm starting to see, just how hard it can be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? 

[All:] You said that we'd been defeated, 
But oh i am so addicted, 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true, 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why. 

[Ben:] No, i don't know why, 
Just tell me why, 
Please tell me why.
