[Chorus x2:]
Age ain't nothing but a number, throwing down ain't nothing but a thang,
This loving I have for you it'll never change

[Verse 1:]
Here I am, and there you are, your eyes are calling me to your heart,
All you gotta do is knock, and I'll let you in,
Then we will feel the passion that flows within,
I don't mean to be bold, but I gotta let you know,
I gotta thing for you and I can't let go

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
Take my hand, and come with me,
And let me show you to ecstasy,
Boy be brave, don't be afraid,
Cause tonight we're gonna, go all the way.
Don't mean to be bold, gotta let you know,
I gotta thing for you, and I can't let go my...
